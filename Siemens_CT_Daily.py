# PyWAD is open-source software and consists of a set of plugins written in python for the WAD-Software medical physics quality control software.
# The WAD Software can be found on https://github.com/wadqc
#
# The pywad package includes plugins for the automated analysis of QC images for various imaging modalities.
# PyWAD has been originaly initiated by Dennis Dickerscheid (AZN), Arnold Schilham (UMCU), Rob van Rooij (UMCU) and Tim de Wit (AMC)
